task using JSON tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to the following tools: 'retriever', 'final_answer'\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob, ending with '<end_action>'.\nSpecifically, this json should have an `action` key (name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (input to the tool).\n\nThe $ACTION_JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. It should be formatted in json. Do not try to escape special characters. Here is the template of a valid $ACTION_JSON_BLOB:\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}<end_action>\n\nMake sure to have the $INPUT as a dictionary in the right format for the tool you are using, and do not put variable names as input if you can find the right values.\n\nYou should ALWAYS use the following format:\n\nThought: you should always think about one action to take. Then use the action as follows:\nAction:\n$ACTION_JSON_BLOB\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $ACTION_JSON_BLOB must only use a SINGLE action at a time.)\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nThought: I need to transform the image that I received in the previous observation to make it green.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}<end_action>\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"action\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}<end_action>\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}<end_action>\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nThought: I will now return the generated image.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"action_input\": \"image.png\"\n}<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code evaluator to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nAction:\n{\n    \"action\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"action_input\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}<end_action>\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nThought: Now that I know the result, I will now return it.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"action_input\": \"1302.678\"\n}<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nAction:\n{\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"action_input\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}<end_action>\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nThought: Now let's get the population of Shanghai using the tool 'search'.\nAction:\n{\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"action_input\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has a larger population. Let's return the result.\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"action_input\": \"Shanghai\"\n}<end_action>\n\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n- retriever: Using semantic similarity, retrieves some documents from the knowledge base that have the closest embeddings to the input query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The query to perform. This should be semantically close to your target documents. Use the affirmative form rather than a question.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. ALWAYS provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and an 'Action:' sequence that ends with <end_action>, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names in the 'action_input' field, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[38;20m===== New step =====\u001b[0m\n===== Calling LLM with this last message: =====\n{'role': <MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, 'content': 'Task: Using the information contained in your knowledge base, which you can access with the \\'retriever\\' tool,\\ngive a comprehensive answer to the question below.\\nRespond only to the question asked, response should be concise and relevant to the question.\\nIf you cannot find information, do not give up and try calling your retriever again with different arguments!\\nMake sure to have covered the question completely by calling the retriever tool several times with semantically different queries.\\nYour queries should not be questions but affirmative form sentences: e.g. rather than \"How do I load a model from the Hub in bf16?\", query should be \"load a model from the Hub bf16 weights\".\\n\\nQuestion:\\nWhat was Dumbledore\\'s original plan regarding the Elder wand and how did Harry ultimately become the master of it?'}\n\u001b[38;20m===== Output message of the LLM: =====\u001b[0m\n\u001b[38;20mAction:\n{\n  \"action\": \"retriever\",\n  \"action_input\": {\"query\": \"Dumbledore's original plan regarding the Elder wand\"}\n}\n\u001b[0m\n\u001b[38;20m===== Extracting action =====\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33;1m=== Agent thoughts:\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33;1m>>> Calling tool: 'retriever' with arguments: {'query': \"Dumbledore's original plan regarding the Elder wand\"}\u001b[0m\nRetrieved documents:\n===== Document 0 =====\nTHE FLAW IN THE PLAN\nAs his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end.
