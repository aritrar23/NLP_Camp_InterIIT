# NLP_Camp_InterIIT
A repo where I dump all my NLP 'research' for Inter-IIT prep.

i) My notebook on QLora implementation (finetuning a LLM on English poems) -  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IsoJBa4lEOcbQk__HNgHrRXi8bzyd1Ko?usp=sharing

ii) Harry Potter Chatbot - I wrote this notebook quite a while back. I am posting it here since it is relevant. It should be run on Kaggle. This is a vanilla RAG-based chatbot (using Gemma2 from Ollama) on the entire Harry Potter book series. I had hosted it on Streamlit.
